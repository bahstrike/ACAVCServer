# ACAudio Voice Chat Server
The server component which supports voice chat for [ACAudio](https://github.com/bahstrike/ACAudio)

Should be cross-platform; requires .NET Core 6.0. _Only Windows binaries might be in Releases, sorry!_

This project is comprised of two components:
- ACAVCServerConsole: Console application that can be used as-is and also demonstrates the performance metrics available from server
- ACAVCServer: Actual library that implements the entire server operation; to be used from any project
